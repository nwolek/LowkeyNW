## About
This GitHub project is a [package for Cycling74's Max](https://cycling74.com/2013/03/11/max-6-feature-packages/), versions 6.1 or higher. It gathers updated versions of projects that were formerly distributed separately as:

* [granular toolkit](http://www.nathanwolek.com/tag/granular-toolkit/)
* [gverb~](http://www.nathanwolek.com/tag/griesinger/)
* [cpPan~](http://www.nathanwolek.com/2006/03/cppan-object/)

It also includes several items that were lurking on my hard drive and never formally released. My goal is to slowly gather as much of my Max work here as possible, so that it is easier to track changes and share with others. I am also producing [short YouTube videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG8vJUg0ALmuKZIw_BqdO1WK0qPdhGjDK) as I go along, so that people can easily see and hear what these items do.

Externals are currently only compiled for the Mac version of [Cycling74's Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max/). If you would like to help compile a binary for Windows, please contact me.

## Installing

If you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed, you can install via the Terminal using the following commands for Max 7:

	cd ~/Documents/Max\ 7/Packages
	mkdir LowkeyNW
	cd LowkeyNW
	git clone https://github.com/nwolek/LowkeyNW.git
	
For Max 6.1, replace the first line above with the following, and then proceed with the remainder:

	cd ~/Documents/Max/Packages

If you do not have Git installed, you can [download the latest release here](https://github.com/nwolek/LowkeyNW/releases). After decompressing the zip archive, the resulting folder can be placed in one of the following folders:

* `~/Documents/Max\ 7/Packages`
* `~/Documents/Max/Packages`
