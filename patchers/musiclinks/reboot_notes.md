# Musiclinks reboot

## Next steps on 28 March 2017
1. memory / query system so that new tracks get current settings from network
2. better way to display scale struct -- is that a kslider? YES

	random, arp (up, down, up-down), one pitch
4. Master control is sent from Max. Is this OK?

6. durations
